A brief share of thoughts.
I have to say, understanding Neural Networks is not that hard. By following the class cs231n from Stanford, I can get a clear understanding of Neural Networks although I believe there is a lot more conceptually and mathematically. I mean it is not as hard as most first-timer would think. NN is a very brilliant idea with uncomplicated concepts, especially Convolutional Neural Network. The difficult part is how do we find these methods, such as backpropagation and batch normalization, and how we are going to improve it. There are obvious problem to Neural Networks that have not been solved, such as that ReLU is not zero-centered and can cause dead neurons. That is what researches are for, to discover a better way. We can see that new papers come out all the time talking about a possible approach to improve NN. It is a very active field of research and no one knows what lies ahead; that is what so called "state-of-the-art" and what makes it fun and exciting.
