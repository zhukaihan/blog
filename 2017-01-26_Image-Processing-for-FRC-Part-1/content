**Image Processing** -- In imaging science, image processing is processing of images using mathematical operations by using any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, a series of images, or a video, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image.

**FIRST Robotics Competition** (FRC) -- an international high school robotics competition. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition">Wikipedia</a>)

**OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision) --  a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition">Wikipedia</a>)

**GRIP** (the Graphically Represented Image Processing engine) -- a program for rapidly prototyping and deploying computer vision algorithms, primarily for robotics applications. (<a href="https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/wiki">GRIP</a>)

We are now in 2017 and FRC 2017 season is obviously started.
We need to recognize something like this.
