<h2>Starting, Resources</h2>
        Follow Caffe and TensorFlow's tutorials will give a very good understanding of how to use the library. Tweek with parameters to see what will happen.
        To learn Convolution, I found a blog from Tim Dettmers to be very useful (http://timdettmers.com). Especially his post "Understanding Convolution in Deep Learning". Read over a couple times, not just one time. It has very well formed sentences to tackle with, also made understanding convolution simple.
        Of course, CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition at Stanford is very useful (http://cs231n.github.io). It explains different layers very well.
        Also,  CS224d Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing is a good place to start deep learning (http://cs224d.stanford.edu).
